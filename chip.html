                <h3>Development Process</h3>
                <p>
                    The development of this simulation was centered around creating an efficient and dynamic environment for a robot to navigate using Manhattan distance for pathfinding. The primary objective was to enable the robot to calculate the shortest possible path by evaluating only horizontal and vertical distances between its current position and the goal. This approach helped optimize the robot's movement within the grid-like environment, ensuring it could quickly and accurately reach its target.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Priority queues played a crucial role in the decision-making process, enabling the robot to search for the most optimal path towards the nearest goal. By organizing potential paths based on priority, the robot was able to make intelligent decisions, selecting the most efficient route towards its objectives. This method allowed for faster calculations and improved the robot's overall performance in real-time simulations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To visualize the robot's movement and its interaction with the environment, visuals were sourced from the Chip's Challenge Game website. These provided a clear and engaging representation of the robot's path and its surroundings. The visual integration was essential for providing users with a better understanding of the robot's decision-making process, making it easier to track its movements and actions in the simulation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The robot’s decision-making process was governed by a closest-item-first strategy, where it prioritized the nearest goal, whether it was a key or a chip. By focusing on the closest objective, the robot avoided unnecessary detours, ensuring that it moved efficiently across the environment. This strategy was implemented in the form of a search algorithm, which dynamically evaluated the robot's options and made real-time adjustments based on the layout of the environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, the development process involved a combination of search algorithms, visualizations, and intelligent decision-making strategies to create a functional and engaging robot simulation. These elements worked together to provide a seamless and efficient experience, where the robot could autonomously navigate and complete its tasks in an optimized manner.
